After Alex wanted to get more involved in getting up a website, he has ported the blog to Hugo. Thank you! ItÂ´s now easier for me, to publish and manage the blog.

Over the comming 2 weeks you will get some new content:

- Acquiring an ASN (e.g. being a part of the Internet)
- Acquiring a VPS with BGP Support
- Running a PowerDNS Cluster with mutible slaves (including Anycast)
- Setting up a Webserver with NGINX, TLS1.3 and HTTP/2
- Setting up a Mailserver Cluster

And some features, some of you wanted: 

- each of my posts will become Multilingual
- Links to my Social Media profiles



So stay tuned!
