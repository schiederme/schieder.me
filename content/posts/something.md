On December the 2th 2018 I published my blog with a not finished post and a basic design.
Today I had the time to redo the Blog from scratch.

So here it is and I also have uploaded it to [GitHub](https://github.com/schiederme/blog).
The design is borowed from [Leo](https://leo.im), which I follow since his time on frewhost, with some changes.

In the near future, I will publish some posts about LibVirt, Linux, Zeug and Minimalism.
For now you can follow me on [Mastodon](href="https://s.schieder.me/@maxi) and [GitHub](href="https://github.com/schiederme").
