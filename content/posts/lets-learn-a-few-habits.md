Yesterday I published a short Blog Post, with an Update about the Blog. I noticed, that I feelt a lot better after publishing it. Whene I write, I´m in a small world with endless posibilitys. 

Every so often I struggle with depression and anxiety. But I want to take my life in my own hands. So in the next 30 days, I will try to learn a few habits. This will help me getting more done and beaing more "wightless".

Here are the habits:

- Wakeup at 4am
- Take a cold shower
- Write a short Article about what I do today and have done Yesterday
- going out for a walk

Thats all stuff, which help me to keeping my head on track. Four habits at once are a huge task. But I will give it a try ;-) Stay tuned!
